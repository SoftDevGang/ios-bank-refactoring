# Help my tests are slow!

There are tests for this application, but they are excruciatingly slow! I'm told tests can be blazingly fast
and that in doing so the code gets better. Problem is that I don't know how to write fast unit tests for code
that is as coupled to the UI as this is, let alone what the improvenent in design could be!

Please help me refactor to make we want to work with tests again!
